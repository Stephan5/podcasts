Matt zordon'd into Warmode studios for a zoom cast this week. Piping hot zoom cast as a matter of fact. It ends abruptly because they just ripped two hrs. The other half will be on patreon. Please enjoy. God Bless you all.

            HELLO! We're here to share many tier 2 thoughts for you all to enjoy. Power God stuff. It's just the D.A.W.G.Z. back on the Big Kahuna's old stompin' grounds. There was a scheduled power outage in Westchester for some reason so there's no video this week. Very upsetting, but that makes no difference to you if you're reading this and listening to the audio. So please enjoy. God Bless. 
            ps I'm putting together a slide show to accompany the cast as a supplement for the video. Will post on YouTube this evening.

        <description>The D.A.W.G.Z. have transitioned to B.R.O.Z. for the week and have been horsing around down at the beach. Beers, vape pens, microdosers, paddle ball, skim boarding, HARD seltzers and everything. 

            God bless you dudes and keep it tight. The love is real. Don't for a second trick yourself into thinking it's not. 

            Also...please keep in mind that the universe (according to science even) is comprised of indestructible, eternal energy. You, my friend, are also made of that same energy. Don't ever forget that.

        <description>Shane has made a serious choice in terms of how he expresses himself in fashion. Matt took the wrong tincture thinking it was CBD and got stung toward the end of the ep when he tried to explain his 2021 goals. 

            Either way, we push on into this strange and disconnected reality we now inhabit...forever in darkness.

        <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/8387247</link>
        <description>How cool is it that we basically have two presidents right now? It's like everyone wins. Also, can't freaking wait to be more united with all of my American brothers and sisters more than ever. And if anyone tries to get into our more-united-than-ever country we'll detain them, or let them chill. Whatever. These issues are totally up to us now. Right? 

            Either way, it's good to be back to normal. Excited to return to forcibly extracting resources from foreign nations under the guise of national security.

        <itunes:summary>How cool is it that we basically have two presidents right now? It's like everyone wins. Also, can't freaking wait to be more united with all of my American brothers and sisters more than ever. And if anyone tries to get into our more-united-than-ever country we'll detain them, or let them chill. Whatever. These issues are totally up to us now. Right? 

            Either way, it's good to be back to normal. Excited to return to forcibly extracting resources from foreign nations under the guise of national security.

        <title>Ep 312-Fat Attack</title>
        <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/8387257</link>
        <description>All give some and some give all. You know what side we're on.

            Also, try not to let all this bullshit on the news get you upset. Focus on your own life instead. Your job, your relationships, building an inhabitable future for the kids. That's what's truly important. All this other stuff is bullshit. Just some dickhead getting mega paid to read a script that is designed to upset you into taking irrational action.

            Don't buy the hype.

            In this episode we discuss hot babes on IG (obviously), evil hippies, rest stop showers, the news, and fat attacks. 

             

            God Bless

        <description>Peace has been restored within the nation, but things are still tumultuous in the outside world. Netflix is taking advantage of Australians, a place blew up, as Shane continues to amass the mega doss on Native American history, particularly the Comanches. On top of this covid business, we've also just learned that people are being, shall we say, sexually attacked by interdimensional beings en masse according to one of the nations most senior medical experts. Be careful out there.

        <description>Shane had a big weekend down at the Williams Grove Speedway. The white claws were flowing. Funnel cake popping. Though nobody died this time which sucks. Cusk, on the other hand, was too sleep deprived to really say what he was up to. Def didn't crum tho.

        <title>Ep 301- Fat Sparta</title>
        <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/8387269</link>
        <description>Bad week for some. Great week for others. Our enemies are many, yes. But, our cadre of loyal dawgz continues to grow. Incorporation, and personal expansion. This is the way we move. 

            Some call this a podcast. Other's call it an immortality project. Perhaps it's both. Then again, perhaps it's neither. 

            Topics include: The Brueger Method, Justin Bieber's favorite comedian, Bae repellent, the propaganda show, and a bunch more stuff.

        <description>First day in the new studio with full video. There was a wee bit of construction above us as well. And the audio got weird from 1:42-1:58. Other than that though it was great! Really good stuff, guys. So check it out. We talk about Native American gauntlets, defunding the police, and a lot of other stuff.

        <description>Silence falls over the doubly locked down streets of the city as a caravan of Honda Civics and Chevy Cruzes process to the secret location. A team of ample-bodied bulls guide the two operatives to the "secret" location. Fights break out. Chaos ensues. The real D.A.W.G.Z. slip out of the back of a Isuzu Rodeo and gain access to the actual safe house, looking over their shoulders at their body doubles, noting how jacked they are before slipping in through door of an unassuming row home to beam the signal

        <description>In this episode we see the horrible butthole of Shane's Cat. Subjects also include: Shane on the peloton, The inter-generational trap of Walmart brain/body, The first Troop, and both of our current domestic conflicts.

            Also, this should hopefully be the last of our Zoom Chronicles, as the studio should be finished by next week Lord willing.

Cusk has been programming hard, but feels off. He misses Shane and Shane misses him. Can they make it through this trying times? There love is strong, but can it withstand this scourge that definitely is NOT a bio weapon sent to destroy us?

Matt is as bunkered down as ever...actually it would be crazy we died later this week. Just thought of how unflattering this would be as a final project before being taken out by our viral enemy. Stay strong!

        <description>Shane and O'Connies went to the Gettysburg battlefield to pay their respex to all those who gave their lives, not the guys who gave their lives to keep slavery going. That was a pretty gnarly miscalculation on their part. Sux for them. Then we interviewed Shane's Dad, which was tight as H-E-DOuble-L.

        <title>Stink Tank- Ep 1</title>
        <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/8387313</link>
        <description>Had a very weird time with three high-octane D.A.W.G.Z. We vaped, smoked doinks, ate gummies, and then tried to talk about stuff.

            It was super fun. 

            Damn this was sick. Feeling like I pulled off Ocean's 11 or something.  

            Stay cool my D.A.W.G.Z.
