Either way it was super fun and I can't wait to get Shane into the tank so I can tie him up like the little people in Gulliver's Travels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, not sure if you guys are noticing or whatever, but I'm like super west coast lately.

Your job, your relationships, building an inhabitable future for the kids. That's what's truly important. All this other stuff is bullshit. Just some dickhead getting mega paid to read a script that is designed to upset you into taking irrational action. Don't buy the hype.

Solo Pod 1&lt;p&gt;Don't fret...the regular pod is also coming today. Just figured I'd share something I been working on. Was talking to O'Connor about the insanity of doing a solo podcast while down the beach, and being the psychonaut that I am, decided to experience the altered state that is talking to yourself and recording what you say for myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole idea here is just to vibe w you while you're at your job. It's basically a hang...nothing too serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also tossed in a sick track at the end. Just another thing to vibe out on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say in the beginning that I am going to do one of these everyday...and by that I mean record a little. Not release a new one daily...although who knows. Maybe one day I'll be swagging on a million like that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Wed, 08 Sep 2021 14:37:35 GMThttps://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/podcast.blakeslee.uk/matt-and-shane/465-solo-pod-1.mp3
