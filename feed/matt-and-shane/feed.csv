The Shat PropheciesSilence falls over the doubly locked down streets of the city as a caravan of Honda Civics and Chevy Cruzes process to the secret location. A team of ample-bodied bulls guide the two operatives to the "secret" location. Fights break out. Chaos ensues.

Ep-308 Love in AustraliaPeace has been restored within the nation, but things are still tumultuous in the outside world.

On top of this covid business, we've also just learned that people are being, shall we say, sexually attacked by interdimensional beings en masse according to one of the nations most senior medical experts.

Your job, your relationships, building an inhabitable future for the kids. That's what's truly important. All this other stuff is bullshit.
