      <title>563: AUDIO: NEW EPISODE (READ DESCRIPTION)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It Goes Down In The Steam Room! You might have seen this thumbnail and title already but we promise this is a different episode! The editors had a bit of a mix up and the order release for a couple episodes was out of wack. What you watched last week was actually "The Worst Catfish Of All Time". In order for the sponsors to not yell at us anymore than they already do, this episode needs to come out to public today!! So this is the same as the one released on youtube right now! Everything will be fixed and back to normal after today! We love you all and thank you for the support!! Hope you enjoy the episode!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Stephan5/rss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Generated using Stephan5/rss&lt;/a&gt;</description>
