I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan&lt;p&gt;Journalist, presenter, broadcaster, husband, father, vigorous all-rounder – Alan Partridge – a man with a fascinating past and an amazing future. Gregarious and popular, yet Alan’s never happier than when relaxing in his own five-bedroom, south-built house with three acres of land and access to a private stream. But who is this mysterious enigma?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Gordon Partridge is the best – and best-loved – radio presenter in the region. Born into a changing world of rationing, Teddy Boys, apes in space and the launch of ITV, Alan’s broadcasting career began as chief DJ of Radio Smile at St. Luke’s Hospital in Norwich. After replacing Peter Flint as the presenter of Scout About, he entered the top 8 of BBC sports presenters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Alan’s big break came with his primetime BBC chat show Knowing Me, Knowing You. Sadly, the show battled against poor scheduling, having been put up against News at Ten, then in its heyday. Due to declining ratings, a single catastrophic hitch (the killing of a guest on air) and the dumbing down of network TV, Alan’s show was cancelled. Not to be dissuaded, he embraced this opportunity to wind up his production company, leave London and fulfil a lifelong ambition to return to his roots in local radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now single, Alan is an intensely private man but he opens up, for the second time, in this candid, entertaining, often deeply emotional – and of course compelling – memoir, written entirely in his own words. (Alan quickly dispelled the idea of using a ghost writer. With a grade B English Language O-Level, he knew he was up to the task.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He speaks touchingly about his tragic Toblerone addiction, and the painful moment when unsold copies of his first autobiography, Bouncing Back, were pulped like ‘word porridge’. He reveals all about his relationship with his ex-Ukrainian girlfriend, Sonja, with whom he had sex at least twice a day, and the truth about the thick people who make key decisions at the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A literary tour de force, I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan charts the incredible journey of one of our greatest broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;Thu, 29 Sep 2011 03:00:00 GMThttps://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/podcast.blakeslee.uk/alan-partridge/1-i-partridge.mp3
Nomad&lt;p&gt;Narrated by the man himself and written in his unmistakable tone and style, Alan Partridge: Nomad is filled with all the joie de vivre you'd expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Alan Partridge: Nomad, Alan dons his boots, windcheater and scarf and embarks on an odyssey through a place he once knew - it's called Britain - intent on completing a journey of immense personal significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarising his ramble in the form of a 'journey journal', Alan details the people and places he encounters, ruminates on matters large and small and, on a final leg fraught with danger, becomes not a man (because he was one to start off with) but a better, more inspiring example of a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through witty vignettes, heavy essays and nod-inducing pieces of wisdom, Alan shines a light on the nooks of the nation and the crannies of himself, making this a biography that biographs the biographer while also biographing bits of Britain.&lt;/p&gt;Thu, 20 Oct 2016 03:00:00 GMThttps://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/podcast.blakeslee.uk/alan-partridge/2-nomad.mp3
From the Oasthouse - S01&lt;p&gt;From the Oasthouse – Series 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadcaster, writer, philanthroper and one of the first public figures to suggest high-visibility clothing for people manning temporary car parks, the public Alan Partridge is a cherished institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what of the unseen Alan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, this famously private man welcomes us into his home and audibly deshrouds himself for a fascinating series of podcasts. Over the course of 18 generously durated episodes, Partridge grants us full and unfettered access to his off-screen life (within reason).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exchange for a series of payments from Audible, he promises an access-all-areas pass to the nooks and crannies of his hinterland, to reveal a wiser, cleverer, more reflective Alan than many of his more vaunted peers have given him credit for. He then sends the resultant podcasts to Audible ensuring they meet the technical specifications laid down in the contract.&lt;/p&gt;Thu, 03 Sep 2020 03:00:00 GMThttps://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/podcast.blakeslee.uk/alan-partridge/3-from-the-oasthouse-s01.m4a

From the Oasthouse - S03&lt;p&gt;From the Oasthouse – Series 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few humans in the history of civilisation have had a third series of their podcast commissioned. Fewer still have produced one that’s actually any good. Partridge Gordon Alan, or Alan Gordon Partridge to write his name the correct way round, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now as comfortable at the controls of a podcast as he is driving all cars and doing most swimming strokes, Alan returns with a series that whooshes and pinballs around the many areas (there are approximately nine) of his life and brain. And with no regular, contracted broadcasting work to clutter up his days, Alan is free to focus on matters closer to home. Still based at his quasi-rural oasthouse, which now boasts a significantly better kettle than in series one and two, he shares with us thoughts, ideas, hopes and dreams spread across eleven episodes with a mean duration of the twenty minutes stipulated in the contract. Would a better approach have been to let the content of each episode dictate its length? Of course it would but that’s a discussion for another day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So join Alan as he tackles the green eyed monster of envy in his attempts to keep hold of his new love, as he navigates how to re-invigorate an increasingly distracted personal assistant, as he vies for one of the most sought-after car-related ambassadorial positions in all of east Anglia, and as he seeks to track down an old Geordie friend long-presumed dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say there’s nothing more boring than the mundanities of everyday life. Well, Alan’s podcast focuses on literally nothing else. We hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;Thu, 31 Aug 2023 03:00:00 GMThttps://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/podcast.blakeslee.uk/alan-partridge/15-from-the-oasthouse-s03.m4a
Big Beacon&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Big Beacon, Norwich's favourite son and best broadcaster, Alan Partridge, triumphs against the odds. TWICE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an innovative 'dual narrative' structure you sometimes see in films, Big Beacon tells the story of how Partridge heroically rebuilt his TV career, rising like a phoenix from the desolate wasteland of local radio to climb to the summit of Mount Primetime and regain the nationwide prominence his talent merits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then something quite unexpected and moving, because Big Beacon also tells the story of a selfless man, driven to restore an old lighthouse to its former glory, motivated by nothing more than respect for a quietly heroic old building that many take for granted, which some people think is a metaphor for Alan himself even though it's not really for them to say.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving his old life behind and relocating to a small coastal village in Kent, Alan battles through adversity, wins the hearts and minds of a suspicious community, and ultimately shows himself to be a quite wonderful man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The two strands will run in tandem, their narrative arcs mirroring each other to make the parallels between the two stories abundantly clear to the less able reader.&lt;/p&gt;Thu, 12 Oct 2023 03:00:00 GMThttps://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/podcast.blakeslee.uk/alan-partridge/16-big-beacon.m4a
