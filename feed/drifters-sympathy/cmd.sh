  --description "Emil Amos charts the birth and development of the classic archetype 'The Outsider', telling disturbing and often humiliating stories about growing up in a small town in the 90â€™s. Every other episode digs into the archaeology of lesser-known music to illuminate the same themes from a more objective, historical perspective." \
